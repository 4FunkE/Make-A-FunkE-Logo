# Make A FunkE Logo

## Description

I am motivated as a designer to create this application to make it easier for users to create a base idea of a design logo for them to use. They can play with characters colors and shapes to see how their base design will look. I learned how to create tests for my code to check its ability to execute the code. I also used how to use my intergrated terminal to install useful modules to my package JSON.
